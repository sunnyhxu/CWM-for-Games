Rules of Isolation

Setup:
- The game is played on a 1-dimensional line of 13 squares (indexed 0 to 12).
- The board starts completely empty.
- Two players (Player 0 and Player 1) alternate turns, starting with Player 0.

Objective:
- The goal is to be the last player to make a valid move.
- If a player cannot make a move on their turn, they lose.

Movement:
- A player can claim any unoccupied square on the board, PROVIDED that the square is not adjacent to any square that has already been claimed (by either player).
- Once a square is claimed, it remains claimed for the rest of the game.

Constraints:
- You cannot claim a square `i` if `i` is already taken.
- You cannot claim a square `i` if `i-1` is taken (if `i-1` exists).
- You cannot claim a square `i` if `i+1` is taken (if `i+1` exists).

Notation:
- Actions are simple integers representing the index of the square to claim (e.g., '0', '5', '12').
